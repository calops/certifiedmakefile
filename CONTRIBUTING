If you want to contribute, please follow this process:
* Fork the project repository on Github at http://github.com/calops/certifiedmakefile/
* Apply your changes and commit them. Remember:
    * Commits may affect several files, but one commit per feature is prefered.
    * Respect the commit message guidelines: 
        * 55 characters in the header
        * two linebreaks
        * a detailed description of the commit
	* comments must have 80 '#' borders, if too long, 70.
    * Try not to have an unstable state after a commit.
* If you wish so, add your name and e-mail adress in the AUTHORS file, respecting the existing formating.
* When you are confident that your changes are stable, you can open a pull-request on github.
* If your changes are judged worthwhile, they will be merged into the master branch of the repository.
